# Basic Demo of Holland Computing Center
This is a walkthrough demo on machine learning to be run on HCC

### Welcome to HCC
This section is where Hongfeng's slides go, in the future it'd be better for the club to have their own specifically suited to the target audience meshing this section and the one after it. Here's hoping somebody reads this commit history.

### Getting Started with using the HCC
This section is where the slides from 2019 are used to explain where the nodes are, how to use them, and mainly avoid doing something stupid on the head node.

## DEMO!

### Point Overview and Setup
This is where we tell 'em what we're gonna tell em and have them create the initial files (ls, cd, touch), concludes with the bash file doing the slurm hello world (see HCC tutorial materials)

#### SLURM
this is where we explain all the different SLURM options (some may not be relevant until used by the python file)

#### PyTorch Time!
This is where the fun begins

TODO:
- add/review comments explaining the code to the python file
- fill out the rest of these sections
- replicate and confirm alex's $h1t works
